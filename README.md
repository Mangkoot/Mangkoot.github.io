#Neighborhood React map

###-A Udacity FEND (Front End Nano Degree) project


####Project overview
In this project, I was given the task of creating a single-page application using *Google Maps API*, *React* and a *third-party API*.
I chose *Foursquare*.
The third-party API must be included in the Google Maps, to show additional info about the places that are pinpointed.
